## Summary

From the results we can see that males are the majority of bikesharing users. This can be helpful in a number of ways. The company opening in Des Moise may want to focus on marketing techniques to draw in more females so they have a wider variety of genders and overall more users. They could also choose to focus on the male majority as a safer option sine they know they will most likely be the most common gender to participate at the start. Additionally, the results show that most trip durations are under an hour and occur on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursdays. This could help determine the placement and quantity of bikes. It could be beneficial to analyze bike sharing data in different cities to get an idea of how results for smaller cities might vary. It also may be useful to create a visulaization that compares the ages of users to number of bikes as well as age of users compared to gender.
